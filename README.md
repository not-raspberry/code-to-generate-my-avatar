# code-to-generate-my-avatar

<img alt="Rendered avatar" align="right" src="rendered.png"> This project was supposed to be a toy image format but it ended up as code that can generate my Github avatar. That's funny.


## Running

```sh
cargo run rendered.png  # Renders the avatar and saves it as ``rendered.png``.
```
